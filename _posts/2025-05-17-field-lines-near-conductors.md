Understanding how conductors interact with electric fields is critical, yet visualizing them in 3D can be a challenge â€” until now!

I am excited to share an **interactive 3D electric field visualizer near a conductor** that allows you to:

- Choose between two conductor configurations:
  - A **grounded conducting plane**.
  - A **grounded conducting sphere**.
- Watch how the **electric field lines** automatically update in real-time based on the charge's position.
- Toggle between configurations and streamline visibility using the simple UI overlay.

## ðŸ’¡ Whatâ€™s Happening Behind the Scenes?

The **method of images** to simulate how conductors alter the field pattern:
- For the **plane**, a mirror image charge is created.
- For the **sphere**, an image charge is calculated using the classic result from electrostatics.

The electric field is computed numerically and visualized using **streamlines**. Their **color changes with field strength**, giving you both direction and intensity information.

## ðŸ›  Built With
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D rendering
- JavaScript modules for real-time field calculations
- Custom streamline tracing logic using Catmull-Rom curves


ðŸ“¬ Let me know what features you'd like to see next â€” multiple charges? Capacitor plates?
