Understanding the behavior of electric fields in 3D can be challenging â€” especially when dealing with multiple charges and the resulting complex electric field patterns.

To help you grasp this concept more intuitively, I've built an **interactive Electric Field Visualizer** right here on this site!

ðŸ”— **[Launch the Visualizer](/electric-field-visualizer/)**

### ðŸŽ¯ What It Shows

- Smooth electric field lines traced from multiple point charges.
- Field line fading represent the **strength** of the electric field (thick lines are stronger field while thin lines for weak field).
- Realistic behavior â€” field lines **emanate from positive charges** and **terminate near negative ones**.
- Full 3D control with mouse (orbit, zoom, pan).

### ðŸŽ® How to Use

- Click and drag to **rotate** the view.
- Scroll to **zoom** in and out.
- The field automatically updates to show a clear and elegant pattern of how charges interact.

### ðŸ“š Why It Matters

Visualizing electric fields is crucial for understanding concepts like:

- Superposition of fields from multiple charges
- Behavior near dipoles or symmetric charge distributions
- Field intensity and direction in 3D space

This tool complements the theoretical work we do in class and brings textbook diagrams to life.
