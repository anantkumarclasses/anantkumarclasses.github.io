# âš¡ Gauss's Law

According to the Gauss's Law, the **flux of the electric field through a closed surface equals the algebraic sum of all the charges enclosed within the surface divided by $$ \epsilon_0 $$:**

$$
 \boxed{
 \oint_\mathcal{S} \vec{E}\cdot \mathrm d\vec{A} = \frac{q_\text{enclosed}}{\epsilon_0}
 } 
$$

Play the following quiz to find out how much are you familiar with this law.

Good luck!
